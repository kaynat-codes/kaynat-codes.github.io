     <h1>Best friend</h1>
    <h5>The definition of a best friend is a person who you value above other friends in your life, someone you have fun with, someone you trust and someone in whom you confide. The first person you call when you get good news or want to go out for a bite to eat is an example of your best friend.</p>
    <p5>1. Best Friend
Best Friends are very special people in your life. They are the first people you think about when you make plans. They are the first people you go to when you need someone to talk to. You will phone them up just to talk about nothing, or the most important things in your life. When you're sad they will try their hardest to cheer you up. They give the best hugs in the world! They are the shoulder to cry on, because you know that they truly care about you. In most cases they would take a bullet for you, coz it would be too painful to watch you get hurt.</p1>
<h5>I think of my Best Friend and know that she is the person who will be there for me, even when I can't be here for myself, who will cheer me to my greatest heights and who will console me when I've fallen down. She will stand up for me and lie down beside me. She will forgive me when I've hurt her and will, occasionally, even bite her tongue when she could so easily have said, "I told you so."</h4>
